BEM instructional guide


For my project I used BEM (block element modifier) as a naming convention to organize my code in such a way so it would be easy to read and be used by other people.


Positives of BEM:

•	Don’t have to deal with nested elements

•	Everything is selected individually


Step 1: Research
	
Here are some sites I found very helpful in learning BEM:

•	http://getbem.com/

•	https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/

•	https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-the-bem-methodology--cms-19403


Things to avoid: 

•	Don’t override modifiers in an unrelated block

•	Avoid making unnecessary parent elements when the child can exist by itself


Syntax

	block_element--modifier

Step 2: Project

So now that you are an expert with BEM try your hand at applying it to a small site. Download the attached file labeled "demo-site" and get to work applying BEM to the markup structure. Lets see what you can come up with!
